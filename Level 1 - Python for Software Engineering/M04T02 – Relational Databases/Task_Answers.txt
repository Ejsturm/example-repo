Question 1
Normalization is the process of restructuring tables such that data issues such
as info redundancy and errors in data input/updates/delations are minimized.

Question 2
A table is in 1NF when the following conditions are met: 
  * a cell no longer contains more than one value of the same type
  * all attributes are dependent on a primary key that may be composite
  * key attributes are identified--that is, if there are additional
    dependencies/relations with non-prime attributes, those should be 
    identified.

Question 3
A table is in 2NF when the following conditions are met:
  * it is in 1NF already
  * there are no partial dependencies (transitive dependencies are still
    possible at this stage)

Question 4
A table is in 3NF when the following conditions are met:
  * it is in 2NF already
  * there are no transitive dependencies
